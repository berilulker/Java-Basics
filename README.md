# Java Basics

This repository contains my first Java programs.  
I'm practicing **Java fundamentals**: user input, output, conditionals, and formatted printing.

## Files
- **MathApp.java**  
  A program that takes two numbers from the user and displays:
  - Sum
  - Difference
  - Product
  - Quotient (formatted output with `printf`)

- **ParleDeCroissant.java**  
  A French-language app that:
  - Asks user's name and age
  - Checks if they like croissants
  - Responds with personalized messages

- **ÇaySeverMisiniz.java**  
  A humorous app in Turkish that:
  - Asks if the user likes tea
  - Prints a funny official-style warning if they don’t :)
  - Shows conditional logic in action

## What I Learned
- How to use **Scanner** for user input
- Difference between `print` and `println`
- Formatting numbers with `printf`
- Using **if-else conditions**
- Basic project structure in Java

### Next Steps
- Learn **loops** (for, while)
- Add **input validation**
- Explore **arrays**
